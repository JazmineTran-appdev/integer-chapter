# Ask for a personâ€™s age (use gets), then use the current year
# to calculate and display what year they were born in.
#
# Should work similarly (assuming the current year is 2023) to the following:
#
#   "How old are you?"
#   80
#   "Wow, you were born in 1943. You're old!"
#
# Use exactly the same copy ("Wow, you were born...") as above in the output.
# but replace values using string addition or string interpolation.


p "How old are you?"
